# Visualisation

The visualisation component serves as a real-time visualisation of the modeled agent-based simulation.

To visualise agents, you need to provide them with the following properties:
- `x` - the x coordinate of the agent's position
- `y` - the y coordinate of the agent's position
- `alive` - a boolean value representing the color of the agent (`true` is `red`, `false` is `black`)

After setting these properties for your agents, they will be properly displayed in the visualisation window.
