# Aim of the Project

Since agent-based modeling is useful in many scientific fields, it is necessary to allow people with little to none programming background to be able to model agent-based simulations. Therefore, the main reason behind the idea of this project is the market absence of a simple agent-based modeling language available for everyone including people with non-technical background. Because of that, apart from the programming language itself, the user will be able to use the spreadsheet interface which requires only rudimentary programming knowledge. The source code and the table-based editor will be mutually convertible, meaning that the user will be able to use both simultaneously.

The project consists of the following parts.
- **interpreter** - a program that parses and runs the **AgentLang** source code
- **web application** - a web-based interface for editing source code, using the spreadsheet interface and visualising the simulation
