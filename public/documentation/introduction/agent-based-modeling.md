# Agent-based Modeling

Agent-based model is a computational model and a simulation technique that uses autonomous entities (agents) in order to understand the behaviour and outcome of a system over time. It is used in variety of scientific fields, most common of which are social science, epidemiology, biology or economy.

Agent-based models are most commonly implemented as computer simulations, therefore, a programming language for defining agents and their behaviour is necessary to be able to simulate an agent-based model.

That is where **AgentLang** comes into play. It allows for quick and simple simulation modelling using a simplistic code syntax which is easy to understand and use.
