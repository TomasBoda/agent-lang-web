# Logical Expression
Logical expressions are expressions operating on boolean literals and always return a boolean value as the result. They are special types of binary expressions which use the `and` and `or`` operators together with two boolean operands.

```
const bool_value = false;

const log_expr_and = true and bool_value;
const log_expr_or = true or bool_value;
```
