# Project Description

The main purpose of this project is to develop an interpreted programming language designed exclusively for agent-based simulations. The project features an interpreter for the **AgentLang** programming language as well as a web-based interface consisting of a source code editor, agent manipulation components and a real-time visualisation of the modelled simulation.
