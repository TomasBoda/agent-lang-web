Since agent-based simulations do not require fast and efficient processing and runtime, the **AgentLang** interpreter as well as the web-based interface will be developed in **TypeScript** using the **Node.js** runtime environment. For the web-based application, I opted for the **React.js** framework to handle the user interface.
